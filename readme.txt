[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod shows all of the topics, excluding locked topics and recycle board topics, that have not been answered (aka topics that consist of a single post).  Locked topics and topics in the recycle boards are not included in the list because it makes no sense to include topics that can't be replied to....

[b]Version 2.5[/b] adds the ability to restrict by board(s) by using [b]board=[x][/b], where [b][x][/b] is the board ID or IDs seperated by commas.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
There are two new settings under [b]Admin[/b] -> [b]Configuration[/b] -> [b]Modification Settings[/b]:
o Default view for unanswered topics (set to posts view by default)
o Number of days to show unanswered topics (set to 90 days by default)

There is also a new permission under [b]Admin[/b] -> [b]Members[/b] -> [b]Permissions[/b]:
o Can view unanswered topics (not permissable for guests)
